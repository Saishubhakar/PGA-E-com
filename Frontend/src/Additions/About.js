        <div className='Who'>Principles Of PGA</div>
        <div className='WhoInfo'>
          <div className='WhoHead'>PGA is Guided by four policies/principles:</div>
          <ul className='Whoul'>
            
            <li className='Wholi'><span className='WhoTitle'>1) Customer OVER market Competition:-</span>    <span className='WhoSub'>PGA always prioritizes customer/consumer values than beating the market because customers are the reason we are who we are today. Customer satisfication was is and always will be prioratized as our primary goal.</span></li>

            <li className='Wholi'>
              <span className='WhoTitle'>2) Value for price:-</span>    <span className='WhoSub'> The motto of OP-Ecom is to provide value from price to our customer. Most of the products available on our website are price tagged while keeping in mind the majority of our customers who look for quality over quantity and so do we.</span>
            </li>

            {/* Invent new ideas and Simplify them             */}
            <li className='Wholi'>
            <span className='WhoTitle'>3) Invent new ideas and Simplify them:-</span>    <span className='WhoSub'> These days due to internet and social media everyone comeup with new ideas everyday and so do we. But the important thing to notice here is that not every person who gets an idea acts on it mainly for two reasons, either it is not been encouraged or it is too complicated for the users to understand. And that is where we stand-out because in our E-com everytime an idea is given it is implemented properly and with abstraction so that each and every customer can understand it.</span>
            </li>
            <li className='Wholi'>
            <span className='WhoTitle'>4) Streamline the shopping process:-</span>    <span className='WhoSub'>PGA ShoppingHub always strives to provides abstraction to the customers who use it. And online shopping could be a little complicated task if it's your first time doing it. But here none of our customer have to worry about it because our website is simple, neat and abstracted which provides easy user experience.</span>
